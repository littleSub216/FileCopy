<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">What are the highest "nastiness" levels at which you believe your program will
successfully copy an entire directory full of files? (We will test your programs using those levels
on both the client and the server; if all you got working
was the end-to-end check, then please tell us how to test your work. <em>Also: if high network nastiness messes up your ability to deal with file nastiness, you can give us two pairs: e.g. Test my client and server with networknastiness=4 and filenastiness=1 or networknastiness=0 and filenastiness=3)</em></li>
<li class="a">
<!-- replace XX and YY with the actual values -->
Please test my client and server with: networknastiness=XX and filenastiness=YY.
</li>

<li class="q">Is there anything else we should
know about testing your code, or what you expect it to do
(beyond what's explained in your report below)?</li>
<li class="a">
...your answer here...
</li>

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
...your answer here...
</li>


<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>
<li class="a">
...your answer here...
