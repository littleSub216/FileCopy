####  File copy protocol

1. Open the source directory, select one file each time and slice it into packets (512 bytes)
2. Build the sockets, transmit them in binary with the sequence tag (fseek their offset).
3. Send an individual packet for filename and checksum.
4. Open the target directory and reorder the received packets, store them as.TMP.
5. Generate the checksum for the copied files and execute the end-to-end check.
6. If the packet is lost or the file is not complete(false), respond to the client, asking to send the packets again (up to 5 times); else if end-to-end check success, drop the `.TMP`, then go to next file.
7. Go through every file in the directory if success closes the client. Leave  `c150nastydgmsocket` open until the whole directory is copied 

The packet, Build the struct and map them into bytes, transmit, then unmap them at server.
